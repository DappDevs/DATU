# Decentralized Autonomous Trade Union

A *DATU* is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (or DAO) that specializes in the processes related to a specific field or task.

---

Members of the DATU vote on improvements to the organization (similar to a DAO),
however members are in a much tighter knit community of specialists in a particular field or task.

Members operate autonomously from the DATU, but organize their work flows through the DATU,
sharing oppurtunities and trade knowledge freely and openly.

New members are "sponsored" as apprecentices under this organization, learning the proper tools and processes used to do
the task in an effective manner, developing mastery of the subject until they can become full-fledged members themselves.

The DATU allows work to shared in a trustful manner between parties that may not be able to co-habitate the same
workspace all the time, allowing the efficiency and security of a traditional organization to transfer into the digital age.

By organizing members via function instead of by project, members develop a deep mastery of the subject,
adhereing to the Unix philosphy to "Do one thing, and do it well".

Since members are under no obligation to long term goals of an organization,
they are free to organize themselves and their work according to their personal needs,
as well as to develop masteries in other areas in order to diversify their income.

This organizational structure allows the DATU to scale organically to the needs of the marketplace,
and ensures that the tribal knowledge created by the community remains in the community for public knowledge.
