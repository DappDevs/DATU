# DATU Token

The DATU has a central token which is fungible, transferrable, burnable/stakeable, and mintable (by the community).
The DATU token represents the investment of individuals within the community in the wider goals of the DATU.

The Token shall be rewarded to community members who use their time to further goals of the DATU,
as determined by the community members through the design of the Token Minting system,
as well as more casual interactions outside of the Token Mint that add value to the organization.

In addition to the Token as a measure of community engagement, it is also designed as a means
for individuals to gain decentralized access to paying oppurtunities through the DATU's Project Pipeline,
as well as access to apprenticeship talent through the DATU's Talent Pipeline.

It shall be possible to leverage the project management smart contract system outside of this system,
but the system shall provide a measure of convienence and rigor above and beyond what is possible
in the wider ecosystem. This provides incentive for community involvement and growth, and is a natural
mitigation to external forces who wish to co-opt the labor force of the DATU community.

The following explicitly coded oppurtunities to gain newly minted tokens are:
* Participating in an event (1 Token)
* Volunteering for an event (10 Tokens)
* Instructing an event (100 Tokens)

The token flow around bidding and gaining access to work through the decentralized project management tool is:
* Job is created with a suggested token amount, aligned with the complexity of the project
* Users submit encrypted bids during the bid process
* Users stake an amount of tokens during the reveal process equal to their unencrypted bid
* The winner will have their staked tokens burned when accepting the job
* All other bidders can reclaim their tokens once the project is accepted
* When the module is completed through the gating process for that module,
new tokens are minted (according to the difficulty) and awarded to the worker.
